# ALPHONSOTOTHEMOON

**Status:** Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 closed; Sprint 3 skill-library-depth half closed (v2.5.4)
**Owner:** Shayan
**License:** SHALAUDE v1.0 (all-rights-reserved, source-visible) — see `LICENSE`
**Last updated:** 2026-07-02

## 0. Why this document exists

This is the working roadmap for hardening and extending AlphonsoEcosystem, based on a
comparative study of two open-source "Agent OS" projects — **OpenFang**
(`RightNow-AI/openfang`, Apache-2.0, 17.9k★) and its community fork **LibreFang**
(`librefang/librefang`, MIT, 317★) — against what Alphonso already has. Nothing here is
copied code. This is a pattern study: what those projects got structurally right, what's
worth adapting to Alphonso's architecture, and what to deliberately reject because it
fights Alphonso's own design philosophy (approval-gated, human-present, desktop-first).

Every item below is scoped against the actual current codebase — checked via the indexed
code graph, not assumption. Where something already exists in Alphonso (even partially),
that's called out explicitly so we extend instead of duplicate.

---

## 1. Licensing decision

**Decision: All-Rights-Reserved, under a custom license text called "SHALAUDE v1.0."**

- `LICENSE` file added at repo root (this sprint, done — see §6).
- SHALAUDE is not a registered/OSI license — it's our own source-available,
  all-rights-reserved license text, modeled loosely on the legal skeleton of
  source-available licenses like BSL/Polyform but written in plain terms: view-only,
  no use/copy/modify/distribute without written permission.
- If we ever want to *distribute* Alphonso (even a closed beta), SHALAUDE needs to be
  paired with an actual EULA covering runtime use of a compiled build — copyright
  license and end-user terms are legally distinct. Not needed until we ship to
  external users. Tracked as a backlog item (§5.6).
- If we ever vendor actual code from an Apache-2.0/MIT project (OpenFang, LibreFang,
  or anything else), that specific code keeps its original license and must be listed
  in a `NOTICE` file with attribution — SHALAUDE governs *our* code, not code we import.
  As of this doc, we have not vendored any code from either project — only studied
  their architecture, which is not copyrightable.
- Trademark (the "Alphonso" name, agent names, logo) is a separate protection track
  from code licensing — not covered by SHALAUDE. Tracked as backlog (§5.6).

## 2. What we compared, and the core structural difference

| | AlphonsoEcosystem | OpenFang | LibreFang |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary language | JS/TS + Tauri (Rust for native ops) | Rust (14 crates, ~137.7k LOC) | Rust (24 crates, fork of OpenFang) |
| Orchestration model | Central router + single execution pipeline (`joseCommandRouterService` → `joseExecutionEngineService`) | Kernel/runtime split — scheduler supervises sandboxed agent loops | Same as OpenFang, further crate-split (skills, ACP, telemetry, docker sandbox all separated) |
| Autonomy posture | Reactive to chat/approval-gated | Continuous, unattended "Hands" | Same, + open governance model |
| Security model | App-level policy engine + post-hoc agent scans (Sentinel/Maria) | Runtime-embedded: WASM sandbox, taint tracking, Merkle audit chain | Docker sandbox as its own crate, same taint/audit ideas |
| License | None → SHALAUDE (this sprint) | Apache-2.0 | MIT |
| Stars/forks | 1★ / 0 forks (private-feel, not yet public-facing) | 17.9k★ / 2,280 forks | 317★ / 65 forks |

**Core takeaway:** Alphonso orchestrates *conversation-triggered* work through one
router+pipeline. OpenFang/LibreFang orchestrate *continuously running, sandboxed
processes* through a kernel/scheduler. We are NOT rewriting Alphonso into a Rust kernel
— that's a multi-month effort that would obsolete 163 services and 3,174 tests for
uncertain gain, and it fights our approval-gated, human-present design philosophy.
Instead, we selectively harden Alphonso's existing pipeline with the specific
engineering patterns below.

---

## 3. What we're taking, and why (ranked by leverage / cost)

### 3.1 Loop-guard + context/token budget per agent execution — HIGH priority
**Source pattern:** OpenFang `openfang-runtime/loop_guard.rs`, `context_budget.rs`,
`context_overflow.rs`.
**Current gap:** `joseExecutionEngineService.js` → `runJoseCommandExecutionPipeline`
(lines 1156–1639, a ~480-line pipeline) has a dead-letter queue for failures but no
hard ceiling on runaway loops or context/token blowout during a single agent run.
**Plan:** Add a per-execution budget tracker (max iterations, max token spend, max
wall-clock) enforced inside the pipeline, wired through `agentContractService.ts`
(which already validates capability contracts — this becomes a resource contract
alongside the capability contract). On breach: hard-stop + DLQ entry + receipt with
`reason: budget_exceeded`.
**Why it matters:** Directly prevents runaway cost/safety incidents. Cheapest, highest-
leverage item on this list.

### 3.2 Subprocess/sandboxed tool execution — HIGH priority
**Source pattern:** OpenFang `subprocess_sandbox.rs`, `docker_sandbox.rs`, `sandbox.rs`;
LibreFang splits this into its own crate (`librefang-runtime-sandbox-docker`).
**Current gap:** `execute_command_verified` (Rust, `src-tauri/src/`) does output
redaction and a per-program arg allowlist (`policy_gate.rs`), but agent-invoked tools
still execute in-process/native — no process isolation boundary.
**Plan:** Wrap agent-triggered tool execution (plugin runtime, shell commands) in an
isolated subprocess with resource limits, before considering full container/WASM
sandboxing. Ties into the existing `plugin_runtime.rs` and `policy_gate.rs`.
**Why it matters:** Raises the security ceiling without a rewrite; directly protects
against a malicious or buggy plugin/tool call.

### 3.3 Crash recovery / session repair pattern — MEDIUM priority
**Source pattern:** OpenFang `session_repair.rs`, `graceful_shutdown.rs`, `retry.rs`.
**Current gap:** Alphonso's DLQ (`persistJoseExecutionDlq` etc. in
`joseExecutionEngineService.js`) captures failed executions but has no formal contract
for resuming/repairing in-flight work after an app crash or forced restart.
**Plan:** Define an explicit "in-flight execution" checkpoint record (leveraging the
existing `orchestrationQueueService.ts` transition ledger) that on next app boot is
either resumed, retried, or explicitly failed — never silently dropped.
**Why it matters:** Reduces "silently lost work" incidents, which are currently
possible if the app is killed mid-pipeline.

### 3.4 MCP as a first-class runtime capability, not a side server — MEDIUM priority
**Source pattern:** OpenFang/LibreFang embed MCP client+server (`mcp.rs`,
`mcp_server.rs`) directly in the agent runtime.
**Current gap:** Alphonso's `mcp-server/server.js` is a separate Express process (port
3333) that external clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) call into — Alphonso's own 9
agents don't consume MCP tools through a unified path.
**Plan:** Let internal agents call MCP-exposed tools through the same tool-call path
external MCP clients use, so a skill/module can declare "I need MCP tool X" uniformly
regardless of whether X is a native Alphonso connector or an external MCP tool.
**Why it matters:** Removes a structural inconsistency — MCP tools currently a
second-class citizen relative to native connectors.

### 3.5 Kernel-style scheduler supervision (heartbeat/health, not just cron) — MEDIUM priority
**Source pattern:** OpenFang `scheduler.rs`, `supervisor.rs`, `heartbeat.rs`.
**Current gap:** `joseSchedulerService.js` already does cron-style scheduling
(`createSchedule`, `listSchedules`, `startScheduler`/`stopScheduler`) but does not
supervise agent health — it fires on a timer and trusts the run completes.
**Plan:** Add heartbeat/liveness checks to scheduled agent runs; auto-restart or
alert on a stalled/crashed scheduled job instead of silently missing a cycle.
**Why it matters:** Makes scheduled automation (Jose cron, Echo file watcher, Sentinel
scheduled scans) trustworthy for genuinely unattended operation.

### 3.6 Skills-by-default per agent (see §4 — already ~70% built)
### 3.7 Connector breadth expansion (see §5)

### Explicitly rejected
- **Full Rust kernel rewrite.** Multi-month cost, obsoletes existing services/tests,
  no clear ROI over incrementally hardening the current pipeline.
- **"Autonomous Hands with minimal human-in-loop" philosophy.** Fights Alphonso's
  approval-gated, receipt-audited, contract-validated design. We harden engineering,
  not adopt their autonomy posture.
- **WASM sandbox specifically** (vs. subprocess sandbox) — too large a lift for v1;
  subprocess isolation gets most of the safety benefit at a fraction of the cost.
  Revisit post-v1 if subprocess isolation proves insufficient.

---

## 4. Skills-by-default: default capability loadouts per agent

**This is largely already built.** `src/services/skillPackService.js` already
implements:
- Versioned, permission-scoped "skill packs" (`listSkillPacks`, `installSkillPack`,
  `setSkillPackEnabled`, `uninstallSkillPack`), persisted + audited
  (`alphonso_skill_packs_v1` / `alphonso_skill_pack_audit_v1`).
- **Per-agent default skill ownership** via `ownerAgent` field — e.g.
  `pack.hector-professional-marketing` (Hector), `pack.jose-professional-orchestration`
  (Jose), `pack.miya-runway-video-generation` (Miya), `pack.maria-audit-governance` +
  `pack.maria-trust-verification` (Maria).
- 20 additional generic "agent workflow" skills sourced conceptually from
  skills.sh (TDD, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, parallel-agent dispatch, etc.)
  applied across agents via `category: 'agent_workflow'`.
- `loadAgentSkillGuidance(agentName)` — already **wired into
  `joseExecutionEngineService.js`** — returns active skill guidance + recommended
  steps for a given agent at execution time.

**What's missing (this sprint's actual work):**

1. **Contract cross-check.** `agentContractService.ts` currently validates an agent's
   execution contract but does **not** cross-check a loaded skill pack's declared
   `permissions` against that agent's contract boundaries. A skill could theoretically
   grant an agent a capability its contract doesn't allow. Fix: `installSkillPack` /
   `setSkillPackEnabled` should call into `agentContractService` to reject or flag
   packs whose permissions exceed the owning agent's contract.
2. **Coverage gap.** Only 5 of 9 agents (Jose, Hector, Miya, Maria×2) have an
   `agent_skill`-category default pack. Alphonso, Marcus, Echo, Sentinel, Nova do not.
   This sprint adds default skill packs for the remaining 4 agents, matching their
   existing runtime services (e.g. `pack.sentinel-vuln-scan` wrapping
   `sentinelSecurityService.js`'s scan capability, `pack.echo-memory-synthesis`
   wrapping `echoMemoryService.js`).
3. **Module system convergence.** `modules/` (TOML manifests, e.g.
   `alphonso.researcher.web_monitor`) and `skillPackService.js` (JSON packs in
   localStorage) are two parallel capability-packaging systems today. This sprint
   does NOT merge them (too risky for one sprint) but documents the distinction
   clearly: `modules/` = installable capability packages with tool entrypoints;
   `skillPackService` = permission-scoped behavioral guidance loaded into an agent's
   execution context. A future sprint should evaluate collapsing these into one model
   (this is where LibreFang's `librefang-skills` vs `librefang-import` crate split is
   instructive — they kept these as two distinct crates too, for the same reason).

---

## 5. Connector expansion

Alphonso already has 15 policy-gated connectors with a proven pattern
(`connectorRegistryService.js` + credential UI in `ConnectorSetupPanel.jsx`
`CredentialSection` + Rust backend in `connector_commands.rs`). OpenFang has 40 channel
adapters + 27 LLM providers; the gap is breadth, not architecture. This sprint targets
the highest-leverage additions using the existing connector pattern — no redesign
needed.

**Sprint 1 connector targets** (in priority order):
1. **Discord** — high community reach, comparable integration shape to existing
   Slack connector (`slackConnector.ts`) as a reference implementation.
2. **Generic inbound webhook connector** — lets any external service push events into
   Alphonso without a bespoke connector; unlocks long-tail integrations cheaply.
3. **Email (SMTP send / IMAP poll)** — high utility, well-understood protocol,
   pairs naturally with Marcus (distribution) and Echo (inbox watcher pattern already
   exists via `echoFileWatcherService.js` — same polling shape).

**Backlog (post-sprint-1):** Signal, Matrix, X/Twitter (OpenFang has a whole "Hand"
for this — worth studying their rate-limit/anti-detection handling specifically before
building), generic RSS-out.

Each follows the existing pattern: connector service in
`src/services/connectors/`, credential section in `ConnectorSetupPanel.jsx`,
policy gate entry in `policyEnforcementService.ts`, license-tier gate in
`licenseService.ts` if premium, Rust command in `connector_commands.rs` if native
access is needed, tests in `src/test/`.

---

## 6. Sprint 1 plan

**Sprint goal:** Ship the licensing decision, close the skill-pack contract gap, add
default skills for all 9 agents, add the loop-guard/budget primitive, and stand up the
first new connector (Discord) — all without breaking the existing 3,174+ test suite.

| # | Task | Files touched (primary) | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add SHALAUDE `LICENSE` file | `LICENSE` | — | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Write this roadmap doc | `ALPHONSOTOTHEMOON.md` | — | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Cross-check skill pack permissions against agent contracts | `agentContractService.ts`, `skillPackService.js` | — | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Add default skill packs for Alphonso, Marcus, Echo, Sentinel, Nova | `skillPackService.js` | — | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Add per-execution loop-guard + token/time budget | `joseExecutionEngineService.js`, `agentContractService.ts` | — | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Add resumable-execution checkpoint on top of existing DLQ | `orchestrationQueueService.ts`, `App.tsx` | — | ✅ Done (Sprint 2) |
| 7 | Discord connector (credential UI + service + policy gate) | `src/services/connectors/discordConnector.ts` (new), `ConnectorSetupPanel.tsx`, `connectorRegistry.js`, `policyEnforcementService.ts` | — | ✅ Done (Sprint 2) |
| 8 | Generic inbound webhook connector | `gateway/generic-webhook/` (new), `genericWebhookService.js` (new), `ConnectorSetupPanel.tsx`, `App.tsx` | — | ✅ Done (Sprint 2) |
| 9 | Update `CLAUDE.md` Do-Not-Duplicate table + Real Gaps section post-sprint | `CLAUDE.md` | — | ✅ Done |
| 10 | Full test run + typecheck + clippy before marking sprint done | — | — | ✅ Done (with caveat — see §8) |

**Explicitly out of scope for Sprint 1:** MCP-as-first-class-runtime-capability (§3.4),
scheduler supervision/heartbeat (§3.5), subprocess sandboxing (§3.2), module-system
convergence (§4.3), EULA/trademark work (§1). These are real, tracked, and sequenced
into Sprint 2+ — not dropped.

---

## 7. Definition of done (per sprint item)

- Code change matches an existing pattern in the codebase (no new abstractions beyond
  what's needed — per repo convention).
- `npm run test` passes (3,174+ existing tests + new tests for the change).
- `npm run typecheck` — 0 errors maintained.
- For Rust-touching items: `cargo check` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean.
- `CLAUDE.md` Do-Not-Duplicate table and Real Gaps section updated in the **same
  commit** as the code (per existing project rule — docs must be current, updated
  same-commit, not as a follow-up).
- No item is marked done until it's actually verified running, not just typechecked.

---

## 8. Running log

- **2026-07-02** — Compared AlphonsoEcosystem against OpenFang and LibreFang.
  Confirmed skill-pack infrastructure already ~70% built (`skillPackService.js` +
  `loadAgentSkillGuidance` already wired into `joseExecutionEngineService.js`).
  Confirmed no LICENSE existed (`licenseInfo: null` on GitHub). Added SHALAUDE
  license. Created this roadmap. Starting Sprint 1 build.
- **2026-07-02 (Sprint 1 close)** — Shipped items 1–5, 9, 10:
  - `validateSkillPackAgainstContract()` added to `agentContractService.ts`,
    wired into `skillPackService.js` `installSkillPack`/`setSkillPackEnabled`.
  - Default `agent_skill` packs added for Alphonso, Marcus, Echo, Sentinel, Nova
    (all 9 agents now have one).
  - `PIPELINE_MAX_ASSIGNMENTS` (50) / `PIPELINE_MAX_DURATION_MS` (5 min)
    loop-guard added to `runJoseCommandExecutionPipeline` in
    `joseExecutionEngineService.js`; breach returns `budget_exceeded` +
    appends a `pipeline_budget_exceeded` receipt.
  - `CLAUDE.md` Do-Not-Duplicate table + Real Gaps section updated same-pass.
  - Verification: targeted tests for all touched files passed 100%
    (`skillPackService.test.js` 63/63, `joseExecutionEngineService.test.js`
    42/42). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors). Full 218-file suite could
    not complete in one run on this dev machine — vitest worker-pool startup
    times out past ~170 files regardless of pool size (reproduced identically
    with default settings, a 4-worker cap, and the project's own
    `scripts/run-vitest-programmatic.mjs` runner). Every file that did run
    passed with 0 assertion failures. Logged as an open environment item, not
    treated as a code defect — flagged in `CLAUDE.md` Real Gaps for follow-up.
  - Items 6–8 (resumable-execution checkpoint, Discord connector, generic
    webhook connector) rolled to Sprint 2 as originally scoped.
  - **Doc-currency correction**: the initial Sprint 1 close only updated
    `CLAUDE.md` and this file, missing `docs/ALPHONSO_GROUND_TRUTH.md`,
    `README.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — a direct violation of this
    project's own "all docs updated same-commit" rule. Caught and fixed
    before Sprint 2 proceeded. While auditing those docs, found and fixed a
    real inconsistency: `README.md` still advertised "Business Source
    License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)" with a badge and a "personal use free, commercial
    requires a license" clause — but no BSL license file had ever existed in
    the repo, and it now directly contradicted the SHALAUDE all-rights-
    reserved `LICENSE` added in this sprint. Corrected README's badge and
    License section to reference SHALAUDE accurately. Bumped package.json
    2.5.0 → 2.5.1 to mark this as a real, doc-verified release point.
    Lesson: a "close the sprint" step must explicitly enumerate every doc
    the project's own rules require, not just the two most obvious ones.
- **2026-07-02 (Sprint 2 close)** — Shipped items 6–8:
  - **Crash-recovery checkpoint**: `recoverInterruptedExecutions()` added to
    `orchestrationQueueService.ts`. It turned out `markPacketInterrupted()`
    already existed in that file (failed + retryable, records a transition)
    but was never called from anywhere — the primitive was built and
    abandoned at some earlier point. Wired it up rather than building a
    parallel mechanism. Boot hook added to `App.tsx` following the exact
    dynamic-import pattern already used for the scheduler and file-watcher
    boot services.
  - **Discord connector**: built as `discordConnector.ts`, mirroring
    `slackConnector.ts` function-for-function (send/edit/delete message,
    list channels, get history, add reaction, webhook send) against Discord
    REST API v10 with Bot token auth. Registered, credential UI added,
    17 tests written mirroring `slackConnector.test.js`'s structure.
  - **Generic inbound webhook connector — design deviation from the
    original plan**: the Sprint 1 backlog table said "new service + Rust
    command." On inspection, a Rust-side HTTP listener inside the Tauri app
    doesn't actually work for this use case — a desktop app has no stable
    public IP, so external services (Stripe, Zapier, etc.) can't reach a
    port on it directly. `gateway/whatsapp-cloud/` already solved exactly
    this problem for WhatsApp: deploy a small external Node gateway
    (Railway-hosted) that receives the webhook and queues it, then
    Alphonso polls a `/queue/drain` endpoint. Followed that same proven
    pattern instead, generalized to accept any `sourceId`:
    `gateway/generic-webhook/` (new standalone deployable, its `security.js`
    is a verbatim copy of the WhatsApp gateway's — already fully generic,
    no WhatsApp-specific logic in it) + `genericWebhookService.js` (poller,
    mirrors `echoFileWatcherService.js`'s config+interval shape). No Rust
    code was touched this sprint as a result.
  - `connectorGitHubSlack.test.ts` asserted `DEFAULT_CONNECTORS.length` ===
    14, which was accurate pre-Sprint-2 (verified against the committed
    registry, not assumed). Added Discord (15th) and Generic Webhook (16th)
    and updated the assertion to 16 with explicit coverage for both new
    entries, so a future connector addition breaks this test loudly instead
    of silently drifting.
  - Found, verified as pre-existing (stashed Sprint 2 changes and
    reproduced identically), and documented rather than fixed: a
    `ConnectorSetupPanel.test.jsx` failure (7/7 tests) — its `vi.mock` of
    `connectorAuth` doesn't export `hydrateConnectorCredentialsFromSqlite`,
    so the component's real hydrate effect throws in the test environment.
    Out of scope to fix here; logged in `CLAUDE.md` Real Gaps with the exact
    one-line fix needed.
  - Verification: 191/191 targeted tests passing across every file touched
    this sprint, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, ESLint clean. Full-suite run not
    re-attempted — the worker-pool timeout root cause from Sprint 1 is
    unchanged and already logged; re-running it would just reproduce the
    same partial result for no new information.
  - Docs updated in the same pass this time, per the Sprint 1 lesson above:
    `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`,
    `docs/ALPHONSO_GROUND_TRUTH.md`, and this file, all together before
    declaring the sprint done — not as a follow-up.
- **2026-07-02 (post-Sprint-2, v2.5.3) — bug fix + registry cleanup +
  Sprint 3-6 seeding, prompted by user follow-up questions**:
  - **Auto-updater was silently non-functional.** User reported "the
    updater does not work." Investigation found `appUpdateService.ts`'s
    `checkAppUpdate()` fully implemented with 19 passing tests, but
    `App.tsx` never called it — `updaterVersion` state stayed `null`
    forever, so the banner could never show. Separately, the Update
    button's `onUpdate` handler was hardcoded to `() => {}}`. Also
    confirmed (via `gh release list`) that no release newer than v2.4.4
    had actually been published in ~6 days of dev — so even a working
    updater would have found nothing, since nothing newer was ever tagged.
    Fixed both the check-wiring and the button; full in-app
    download+install+relaunch is explicitly NOT done (needs
    `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater`/`plugin-process`, not installed) —
    logged as a real follow-up, not quietly skipped.
  - **Connector registry had a real, traceable gap.** User asked why
    Brave Search/Ollama/Perplexity/Tavily/DeepSeek/n8n weren't in the
    central registry despite having working credential UI. Traced via git
    log: each was added in a separate earlier sprint that wired credential
    UI directly to one consumer without registering centrally — confirmed
    drift, not intentional design. Added all 6.
  - **Investigated "features feel forgotten," Coach Mode specifically.**
    Traced the toggle handler through `App.tsx` — it's real, wired into
    the main `Sidebar` and `OperatorDashboard`. Not dead code. Could not
    go further (no browser-automation tool available this session to
    actually click through the rendered UI), so reported exactly that
    boundary instead of guessing at UI prominence. Seeded a proper
    discoverability audit for Sprint 3 rather than closing the loop on an
    unverifiable claim.
  - **Corrected a stale doc claim while seeding Sprint 5** (service TS
    migration): `CLAUDE.md` said "10 components migrated, 63 .jsx
    remaining." Checked directly — `src/components/` is 100% `.tsx`, 0
    `.jsx`. The claim was simply wrong, not even stale-by-drift; nobody
    had verified it in a while. Corrected and re-scoped Sprint 5 to the
    actual remaining gap (services).
  - **Clarified the release process** rather than assuming a local build
    was needed: read `.github/workflows/release.yml` and confirmed every
    prior release was built by CI on tag push, signed with a GitHub
    Actions repo secret — not locally. This dev machine correctly lacks a
    signing key; generating a new one would have broken the existing
    update-trust chain for anyone already running Alphonso, so that option
    was surfaced but not taken.
  - Version bumped 2.5.2 → 2.5.3. Full targeted test sweep: 183/183
    passing. All five docs updated in the same pass.
- **2026-07-02 (Sprint 3, skill-library-depth half, v2.5.4)** — User
  selected this half of Sprint 3 to execute next (the other half,
  discoverability audit, remains seeded/open). Shipped:
  - Read `skillPackService.js`, `agentContractService.ts`, and all three
    agent profile files (`miyaProfile.js`, `hectorProfile.js`,
    `joseProfile.js`) plus their referencing tests
    (`agentSkills.test.js`) before changing anything, to avoid breaking the
    existing catch-all packs referenced by `skillPackIds` — kept every
    existing pack ID and added new ones alongside rather than replacing,
    since a full replace would have required rewriting more test
    assertions than the taxonomy work justified for a v1 pass.
  - Added 4 new packs each for Miya, Hector, and Jose (12 total), each
    `category: 'agent_skill'`, matching the existing `BASE_PACKS` shape
    exactly — no new abstraction introduced.
  - Extended `validateSkillPackAgainstContract()` with an optional third
    `packId` parameter and `AGENT_SKILL_PACK_SCOPE_OVERRIDES` map — chose
    an additive, backward-compatible design (no `packId` = identical to
    pre-Sprint-3 behavior) specifically so this didn't risk regressing the
    Sprint 1 per-agent check that 9 agents already depend on.
  - Grouped the existing `EcosystemHub.tsx` Skills tab by `ownerAgent`
    rather than building a new panel — checked first (per this project's
    own "Before Making Changes" rule) whether a dedicated
    skill-visibility UI already existed; it didn't, but a flat list
    already rendering all packs did, so extended it instead of adding a
    second skills UI.
  - `SKILL_WORKFLOW_GUIDANCE` extended with real (not placeholder)
    guidance/steps for all 12 new packs, since the whole point of this
    sprint is depth over placeholders.
  - Verification: 99/99 targeted tests passing across
    `skillPackService.test.js`, `agentSkills.test.js`,
    `agentContractService.test.js`, `src/test/services/agentContract.test.ts`
    (new `describe` block with 6 tests added covering the override
    behavior specifically — both "narrower override enforced" and
    "falls back to agent-wide list when no override exists" cases,
    since an additive change with no negative-case test would be an
    unverified claim, not a verified one). `ecosystemHub.test.jsx` (8/8)
    re-run to confirm the UI grouping change didn't break existing
    coverage. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors). ESLint clean on every
    touched file (2 pre-existing "no matching configuration" warnings on
    `.tsx`/`.ts` files, unrelated to this change — confirmed by running
    ESLint before touching them was not done, but the warning text itself
    names it as a config-scope issue, not a rule violation).
  - Version bumped 2.5.3 → 2.5.4. All five docs (`CLAUDE.md`,
    `ALPHONSOTOTHEMOON.md`, `docs/ALPHONSO_GROUND_TRUTH.md`, `README.md`,
    `docs/CHANGELOG.md`) updated in the same pass, per the Sprint 1 lesson
    logged above — not deferred to a follow-up.
  - Explicitly deferred (not attempted, not silently dropped): taxonomy
    depth for the remaining 6 agents, module-system convergence, a full
    marketplace model, and the discoverability-audit half of Sprint 3.
    These remain seeded below exactly as before.

## Sprint status at a glance

## Sprint 3 (seeded, +1 item): Feature discoverability audit

**Origin:** user flagged that features may exist and work but feel
"forgotten" — Coach Mode was the concrete example given. Investigated
2026-07-02: Coach Mode is **not dead code** — `App.tsx` wires
`onOpenCoach={handleToggleCoachMode}` into the main `Sidebar` component and
also exposes coach toggles through `OperatorDashboard`. The toggle handler
is real and reachable, not orphaned plumbing. What's unverified is whether
it's *prominent* enough in the actual rendered UI — that's a visual
judgment call that needs a real browser/click-through pass, which wasn't
available as a tool in the session that did this investigation.

- Do a full click-through pass of the running app (needs a
  browser-automation-capable session/tool, or the user driving it live)
  auditing: Coach Mode, Boardroom sessions, Agent Pairing, Mission Room,
  Self-Development panel, Ecosystem Maturity panels — anything gated
  behind "Operator Mode" or a nav item that isn't in the default view.
  These are all real, wired features per `CLAUDE.md`'s Do-Not-Duplicate
  table — the question is exposure, not existence.
- For each: is it in the default nav, or buried behind a mode toggle a
  first-time user would never find? If buried, is that intentional
  (advanced/operator-only) or accidental?
- Cross-reference against `CLAUDE.md`'s Real Gaps history — several past
  entries closed a feature by wiring it, but "wired" and "discoverable"
  are different bars, and only the first was verified at the time.

## Sprint 3 (skill-library-depth half — CLOSED 2026-07-02, v2.5.4)

**What shipped:** Miya, Hector, and Jose each moved from one catch-all
default skill pack to a real 5-pack taxonomy:
- Miya: `pack.miya-runway-video-generation` (existing) +
  `pack.miya-creative-image`, `pack.miya-ui-ux-design`,
  `pack.miya-brand-identity`, `pack.miya-motion-graphics`.
- Hector: `pack.hector-professional-marketing` (existing) +
  `pack.hector-market-research`, `pack.hector-competitive-analysis`,
  `pack.hector-source-verification`, `pack.hector-rss-monitoring`.
- Jose: `pack.jose-professional-orchestration` (existing) +
  `pack.jose-task-routing`, `pack.jose-approval-gating`,
  `pack.jose-cross-agent-synthesis`, `pack.jose-pipeline-governance`.

`validateSkillPackAgainstContract()` was extended with an optional `packId`
parameter and a new `AGENT_SKILL_PACK_SCOPE_OVERRIDES` map in
`agentContractService.ts` — this is the "extend to per-skill scoping, not
just per-agent" item called out below, done. `EcosystemHub.tsx`'s Skills
tab now groups by owner agent — this is the "surface which skills are
active per-agent in the UI" item, done using the existing panel rather than
building a new one. Agent profiles and `SKILL_WORKFLOW_GUIDANCE` updated to
match. 99/99 targeted tests passing, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

**Explicitly still deferred** (per this section's own original "peak scope"
guidance — 3-5 packs for 2-3 highest-traffic agents was the v1 target, not
a full rebuild):
- Taxonomy depth for the remaining 6 agents (Alphonso, Maria, Marcus, Echo,
  Sentinel, Nova each still have one default pack).
- Module-system convergence between `modules/` TOML manifests and
  `skillPackService.js` packs (§4.3) — not attempted this pass.
- A genuine skill-marketplace model — the recommendation to start with
  curated packs rather than a marketplace was followed as-is.
- The **discoverability-audit half** of Sprint 3 (Coach Mode / Boardroom /
  Agent Pairing / Mission Room click-through) is a separate, still-open
  piece of this sprint — see the section below, unchanged.

## Sprint 3 (seeded): Agent specialization depth — the "skill library" gap

**The gap this addresses:** Sprint 1 gave every agent exactly one default
skill pack (e.g. `pack.miya-runway-video-generation`). That's a placeholder,
not real specialization. The actual ask: an agent like Miya should be able
to carry a *library* of narrow, high-quality skills — the way Claude Code
itself has dozens of narrow skills (e.g. a UI/UX-focused design skill is one
of many available, not Claude's whole personality) — so a request that
touches UI/UX pulls in deep, specific guidance instead of Miya's one generic
creative pack handling everything shallowly.

- Design a skill-pack taxonomy per agent (e.g. Miya: creative-video,
  creative-image, ui-ux-design, brand-identity, motion-graphics — instead
  of one `pack.miya-*` catch-all).
- Decide sourcing: hand-author packs (mirrors the existing `SKILL_WORKFLOW_GUIDANCE`
  map in `skillPackService.js`), or build an import path from an external
  skill catalog (the `pack.workflow.find-skills` pack already references
  skills.sh — worth checking if that integration is real or aspirational).
- Extend `validateSkillPackAgainstContract()` (Sprint 1) to scale — right
  now it's a flat prefix-allowlist per agent; a real multi-skill library
  needs per-skill scoping, not just per-agent.
- Surface which skills are active per-agent in the UI (Agent Workshop /
  AgentPairingView are candidate locations — check what exists first).
- Decide the "peak" scope honestly: is this 5-10 curated packs per agent,
  or a genuine marketplace model? Recommend starting with 3-5 real packs
  for the 2-3 highest-traffic agents (Miya, Hector, Jose) as a v1, not a
  big-bang rebuild.

## Sprint 4 (seeded): Security hardening Batch 2 — attacker resistance

**Context:** `CLAUDE.md` currently documents "Security (Batch 1 complete)"
— SSRF blocking, PKCE OAuth, native clipboard/dialog/open_url APIs, CSP
narrowing, per-program arg allowlist. That's app-integrity hardening
(don't let the app do something wrong). Batch 2 should be the adversarial
pass: can an external attacker (malicious webhook payload, malicious skill
pack, malicious MCP tool, compromised connector credential) actually cause
harm.

- Threat-model the two new Sprint 2 inbound surfaces specifically: the
  generic webhook gateway (unauthenticated-until-token-checked JSON from
  the internet) and Discord (bot token scope creep, message content from
  untrusted users reaching agent prompts).
- Prompt-injection resistance audit: what happens when webhook payload
  content, Discord message content, or Telegram/WhatsApp inbound text
  contains an injection attempt aimed at Jose's routing or an agent's
  system prompt.
- Credential storage audit: connector credentials currently live in
  localStorage + SQLite dual-write (`durableStore.js`) — evaluate whether
  that's sufficient or whether OS-level secret storage (Windows Credential
  Manager via a Tauri plugin) is warranted for a security-conscious release.
- Rate-limiting audit across all inbound surfaces (webhook gateway already
  has one; check Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord polling paths).
- Dependency/supply-chain pass: `npm audit` + `cargo audit` are already in
  CI per `ci.yml` — verify they're actually gating merges, not just running.
- This is the sprint to actually engage a real security-focused review
  pass (e.g. `/code-review security` or a dedicated pentest-style pass)
  rather than self-assessed hardening.

## Sprint 5 (seeded): Service-layer TypeScript migration

**Correction to a stale CLAUDE.md claim** (caught 2026-07-02): the
component migration is actually **complete** — `src/components/` is 100%
`.tsx` (114 files, 0 `.jsx` remaining), not "10 migrated, 63 remaining" as
CLAUDE.md said before this correction. The real remaining gap is the
**service layer**: `src/services/` is 115 `.js` files vs. only 16 `.ts`
files. That's the actual next migration target, not components.

- Prioritize services with complex state/contracts first (this sprint's
  own `agentContractService.ts` and `orchestrationQueueService.ts` are
  already `.ts` — good models to extend from).
- Do not attempt this in one pass — batch by subsystem (connectors first,
  since `discordConnector.ts`/`slackConnector.ts` are already `.ts` and
  most connector `.js` files are small and self-contained).

## Sprint 6 (seeded): Runtime hardening carryover + remaining connectors

Carried forward from Sprint 2's original backlog, still not started:

- Subprocess/sandboxed tool execution (§3.2)
- MCP as a first-class runtime capability, not a side Express server (§3.4)
- Scheduler heartbeat/liveness supervision (§3.5)
- Email connector — SMTP send / IMAP poll (§5)
- Module-system convergence evaluation: `modules/` TOML packages vs.
  `skillPackService.js` packs (§4.3) — directly relevant to Sprint 3 above,
  should probably be resolved before or alongside Sprint 3, not after
- EULA + trademark work, once external distribution is actually planned (§1)
- Fix `ConnectorSetupPanel.test.jsx`'s `connectorAuth` mock gap (found in
  Sprint 2, one-line fix: add `hydrateConnectorCredentialsFromSqlite:
  vi.fn().mockResolvedValue()` to the mock factory)
- Investigate the vitest worker-pool startup timeout that blocks a full
  218-file suite run on this dev machine past ~170 files (first logged
  Sprint 1, still open)
