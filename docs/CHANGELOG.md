## [Unreleased]

### Added (2026-05-31 — Claude Code session, Agent A: Security + Config)
- Content Security Policy production string added to `tauri.conf.json` — replaces prior `"csp": null` (no policy)
- Window size increased to 1280×800 with minimum dimensions (`minWidth: 1024`, `minHeight: 700`)
- Hardware GPU acceleration enabled — removed `--disable-gpu`, `--disable-gpu-compositing`, `--use-angle=swiftshader` flags
- `.env.example` sanitized — real phone numbers in `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` replaced with `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ALLOWED_NUMBERS`
- `docs/SECURITY_CONFIG_REPORT.md` — documents all security configuration changes
- `docs/SECURITY_ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md` — credential rotation checklist covering all 26 credentials

### Added (2026-05-31 — Claude Code session, Agent B: CI + Coverage)
- `cargo test` step added to GitHub Actions `ci.yml` — new `rust-quality` job runs `cargo clippy` and `cargo test`
- `cargo clippy` with `--deny warnings` added to `rust-quality` CI job
- `desktop` CI job now depends on both `test` and `rust-quality` jobs
- 30% line coverage threshold added to `vite.config.js` test block
- `test:coverage` npm script added to `package.json` (runs Vitest with v8 coverage)
- `docs/TESTING_CI_REPORT.md` — documents CI and coverage changes

### Added (2026-05-31 — Claude Code session, Agent C: UX/Connectors)
- `src/components/ConnectorHealthPanel.jsx` — live connector health dashboard with three exports: `ConnectorHealthPanel` (full panel), `ConnectorStatusStrip` (compact sidebar count strip), `ConnectorStatusDot` (per-connector indicator)
- "Connectors" tab mounted in `src/App.jsx` pointing to `ConnectorHealthPanel`
- `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` — "Connectors" nav item added with inline `ConnectorStatusStrip` showing live/missing/disabled counts
- `src/components/ApprovalModal.jsx` — improved approval dialog: connector badge, colored risk level indicator (high/medium/low), irreversibility warning banner, red confirm button for high-risk actions; backward-compatible with existing `label` prop
- `docs/UX_CONNECTOR_HEALTH_REPORT.md` — documents UX changes

### Added (2026-05-31 — Claude Code session, Agent D: Rust backend)
- SQLite WAL mode — `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;` added to `open_memory_db()` for concurrent read/write performance
- Shared `reqwest::Client` — built at startup, registered via `.manage()`, shared across `connector_poll_telegram`, `connector_send_telegram`, `connector_send_chatgpt`, `connector_send_claude`
- 14 Rust unit tests added in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `lib.rs`: covers `allowed_program`, `plugin_blocked_token_present`, `validate_plugin_extra_args`, `trim_trailing_slashes`, `wal_pragma_applies_on_in_memory_db`, `to_hex`, and more — all passing
- Runtime `.unwrap()` audit — 1 runtime panic replaced with safe `match + continue` in `fetch_research_sources` (~line 5859); 2 startup-only `.expect()` calls intentionally kept
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_RUST_REPORT.md` — documents Rust backend changes

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

Initial production-ready baseline. Summary from `docs/ALPHONSO_PRODUCTION_COMPLETION_REPORT_2026-05-13.md`:

### Added
- Jose orchestration durability: `orchestrationQueueService.js` with full state transitions (`new → pending_approval → queued → reported_to_jose → dead_letter/failed`), dead-letter replay, and manual interrupt
- `orchestrationReceiptService.js` — receipt events at every pipeline phase (assignment, policy block, retry, dead-letter, merge/confirm, pipeline completion)
- `policyEnforcementService.js` — centralized fail-closed policy gate for all connector sends
- `connectorRegistryService.js` — all outbound connector paths (Telegram, WhatsApp, Claude, ChatGPT, Notion, ClickUp, YouTube, SD WebUI, ComfyUI) run through policy gate
- Zero-cost mode enforcement — blocks paid connectors by default
- Approval mode enforcement — risky external sends require user approval
- WhatsApp Cloud inbound architecture: payload normalizer (`normalizeWhatsAppCloudInboundPayload`), simulation harness, Rust verification helpers (`verify_whatsapp_cloud_webhook_challenge`, `verify_whatsapp_cloud_webhook_signature`, `normalize_whatsapp_cloud_inbound`)
- 5 governed agents added to the roster: Maria (governance/audit), Marcus (approved distribution), Echo (memory historian), Sentinel (security monitoring), Nova (opportunity intelligence) — joining Alphonso, Jose, Hector, Miya
- `agentContractService.js` — per-agent allowed/blocked action enforcement
- `agentBusService.js` — inter-agent messaging bus
- `workflowOperationsRegistryService.js` — 10 structured workflows: Marketing Ops, Social Media, Content Production, Learning, Startup/Product Dev, Opportunity Discovery, Construction Ops, Knowledge Preservation, Content Repurposing, Automation Governance
- Memory governance metadata — `memoryService.js` and `durableMemoryService.js` extended with workflow owner, sensitivity, retention policy, privacy/governance status
- `pluginSandboxService.js` — plugin isolation and sandbox enforcement
- `runtimeLedgerService.js` — runtime event ledger (SQLite-backed)
- Trust/receipt browser in UI — merges verification receipts and orchestration receipts
- 37 test files in `src/test/` covering Jose pipeline, connectors, orchestration, WhatsApp, Ollama, approval enforcement, workflows, and more; 88 tests all passing
- Two GitHub Actions workflows: `ci.yml` (lint + test + build + Tauri NSIS/MSI artifact) and `verify-app.yml` (verify:app script)
- `npm run release:updater` — one-command Windows installer release pipeline (NSIS + MSI + Tauri updater signed manifest)
- Auth helper scripts: `auth:youtube`, `auth:meta`, `auth:outlook`
- Desktop preflight/verify scripts: `verify:desktop:preflight`, `verify:desktop`
- Railway gateway for WhatsApp Cloud inbound (`gateway/whatsapp-cloud/`) — setup_required until hosted endpoint verified

### Architecture
- Tauri v2 (Rust 1.77) + React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind 3
- SQLite via rusqlite (bundled) for durable memory and kv store
- Ollama local inference (`llama3.2:3b` default)
- Windows NSIS + MSI installer
- All `.jsx` (no TypeScript migration)
