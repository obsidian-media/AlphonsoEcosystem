# Governance Bootstrap Audit — 2026-07-23

Agent: Hermes
Scope: Governance Bootstrap
Status: completed (bootstrap)

## What was added
- REPO_RULES.md v1.0.0 (39 rules + 8 appendix sections).
- AGENTS.md pointer.
- docs/ index, docs/governance/DEFERRED_WORK.md, BRANCH_POLICY.md.
- audits/ workspace + audits/private/ (gitignored).
- scripts/verify.sh + verify.ps1 (repo-adaptive CI gate).
- .github/workflows/gate.yml (secret-scan, doc-freshness, build, test, deploy-dry).
- .gitignore secrets/build/IDE coverage.

## Verification
- Branch created: agent/hermes-governance-bootstrap (never main).
- Docs baseline captured: md_count=98.
- Next step: run `bash scripts/verify.sh` and open PR for Shayan approval.

## Residual risk
- Repo-adaptive detection in scripts/verify.sh may need tuning per stack.
- GitHub branch protection (Rule 26) must be enabled in repo settings.
